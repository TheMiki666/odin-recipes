    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <em>Tortilla Espa√±ola</em>, or Spanish Omelette, is an omlette made of potatoes and onions, very typical to eat as a <em>tapa</em> (a little dish that accompanies a drink).</p>
    <p>Warning: if you don't use onions to make the Spanish Omelette, <strong>then it's not a Spanish Omelette</strong> (I would say it is not even a omelette!).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 or 5 medium potatoes</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (if you forget it, the omelette will turn poisonous)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and onion.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion into very small pieces.</li>
        <li>Get a new frying pan, making sure the Teflon coating is not worn out.</li>
        <li>Put a little olive oil in the pan and start frying the onion over a low heat.</li>
        <li>While the onion is frying, cut the potatoes into very thin slices.</li>
        <li>Add a little more olive oil to the pan and fry the potatoes over a low heat, stirring them every so often so they don't burn and they are all fried.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are soft and golden, remove them along with the onion.</li>
        <li>Beat the 6 eggs in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Once beaten, add the potatoes with the onion and a pinch of salt. Mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Use the oil in the pan and heat it up. If there is very little left, add a little more, but don't overdo it; there should be a thin layer of oil that covers the entire pan.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, add the egg and the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Fry everything over a low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. You can use a wooden fork to gently lift the sides, making sure they don't stick.</li>
        <li>When the bottom is set, it's time to turn it over: grab a plate, put it upside down on the omelette, and flip the plate and pan over. Don't be a show-off trying to flip it in the air; the result can be disastrous.</li>
        <li>Put another thin layer of oil on the pan, and fry the other side of the omelette. It will be done in no time, be careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>And eat!</li>
    </ol>
